\section{} 

The method of transit photometry has proven indispensable in the detection and characterization of thousands of exoplanets over the past few decades \citep{2007prpl.conf..701C,2009IAUS..253...99W,2010exop.book...55W,2010trex.book.....H}. Transits are particularly useful for determining relative radii \citep{2019A&A...623A.137H}, constraining orbital inclination \citep{2003ApJ...585.1038S}, and the planet's orbital ephemeris. These quantities all have to be inferred using a computed model of the planetary transit. Model accuracy directly affects the inference of these parameters and a recent study by \citet{2020AJ....159..123A} has improved numerical accuracy of the popular quadratic limb-darkening law \citep{2002ApJ...580L.171M} to within $\mathcal{O}(10^{-15})$ along with analytical derivatives. This study directly probes the speed and accuracy of various limb-darkening laws, and we seek to improve upon that work and study how different models affect the statistical inference of transit parameters.

The following packages which provided limb-darkened transit curves were tested: \texttt{exoplanet} \citep{2019ascl.soft10005F}, \texttt{BATMAN} \citep{2015PASP..127.1161K}, \texttt{PyTransit} \citep{Parviainen2015}, and \texttt{EXOFASTv2} \citep{2019arXiv190709480E}. These libraries have a variety of limb-darkening laws, but all have a quadratic limb-darkening law following the framework of \citet{2002ApJ...580L.171M}. In addition, \texttt{exoplanet} and \texttt{EXOFASTv2} have entire statistical modeling frameworks built into or on top of the transit curves. We also test \texttt{Juliet} \citep{2019MNRAS.490.2262E}, which adds a statistical modeling framework to the \texttt{BATMAN} transit models.

To begin, we used the highly accurate \citet{2020AJ....159..123A} transit models to simulate a light curve. We build a hierarchical model using the \texttt{exoplanet} framework with the following parameters: the semi-major axis, orbital period, time of inferior conjunction, ratio of planet to stellar radii, limb-darkening coefficients, and out-of-transit noise. The ground truth parameters were chosen to roughly mock the Kepler-101b transit \citep{2014A&A...572A...2B} and are shown in \autoref{table}.
